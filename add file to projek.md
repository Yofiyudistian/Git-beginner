## Add files to your project
Adding files to your project is not just drag and drop.

Besides moving files into your directory, you need to type some commands.

You can add files using the commands:

``` git add <filename> ```

``` git add * ```

This is the first step when working with git. To commit these changes use the command:

``` git commit -m "Commit message" ```

Now the file is committed, but it is not your remote repository yet.
