## Remote repository
Online Git services

You can put your project online in a so called remote repository. By doing this, multiple people can work on the same project.

There are several free services available for this including Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket. You may also choose to setup your own Git service using Gogs.



Putting your Project online

By typing the ``` git commit ``` command your changes are in your local working copy.



To send  to remote repository:

```git push origin master```



To connect to a remote repository:

```git remote add origin <server>```
